# Perceptual Phenomenon Project

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to study the [Stroop Effect][1]

## Question 1: Indentify variables in the experiment
The independent variable is the type of the words condition. Congruent or incongruent
The dependent variable is the time needed to read the test.

## Question 2a: Establish hypotheses
We can establish the null hypothesis as the fact that the congruent and incongruent type does not effect the time to read the test.

$H_0$ is the congruent and incongurent words test results are comparable

$H_a$ is the congruent and incongruent words test results are diffenrent

The hypothesis one is the time to read the congruent words condition is significantly less than the incongruent words condition.

## Question 2b: Establish statistical test

## Question 3: Report descriptive statistic

## Question 4: Plot the data

## Question 5: Perform the statistical test and interpret the results

## Question 6: Extending the investigation
